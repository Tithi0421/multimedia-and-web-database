Dear all,

So far we covered, the following:

-What is mutimedia?
    -Semantic Heterogeneity, fuziness, subjectivity, ranked processing, etc.

-Abstract models (Set, vector, sequence, tree, graph)

-Vector Spaces

-Similarity/Distance
    -Euclidean Distance
    -KNN
    -Range Search
    -Metric Distance (Minkowski Metric)
    -Mahalonobis Distance
    -Covariance Matrix
    -Quadratic Distance
    -Intersection Similarity
    -Angle-Based Measure
        -Dot Product
        -Cosine Similarity
    -KL-distance
    -Earth-movers distance

- Feature Selection
    -Dimensionality Curse
    -Entropy
    -Variance
    -False positives and Misses

- High-to-Low Dimensional Embedding/ Eigen decomposition
    -Principal Components Analysis
    -Singular Valued Decomposition and Latent Semantic Indexing

- High-to-Low Dimensional Embedding/Generative models
    - Probabilistic Latent Analysis
    - Latent Dirichlet Allocation
    - Expectation Maximization

-Tensors and tensor decompositions
    - CP Decomposition
    - Tucker Decomposition

- Distance-preserving Vector-Space Embedding of Objects

    - Multi-Dimensional Scaling    

    - Fastmap

    - Auto-encoders

- Sequence/time series representations

        - Edit Distance

	- Dynamic Time Warping

	- SAX

- Graph representation

        - Vector space view of graphs

	- Node ranking (hubs/authorities and PageRank)

	- Node distance (PPR) 
-Index structures
       - 1D search (sorting, pruning, search trees)

	- multi-dimensional to 1D mapping

	- GridFiles 

	- Page utilization and "dead spaces" 

In addition to these, project-related content may also be included among the midterm exam questions.

Best,

KSC
